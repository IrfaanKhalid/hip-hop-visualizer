# hip-hop-visualizer

## What is hip-hop-visualizer?
This is a toy project intended to let me do a couple things.
+ Play with the Reddit PRAW API.
+ Work a bit more in Python
+ Keep me entertained after finals.

## What are the goals?
A high-level vision for this project - analyze basic trends in the appearance of different hip-hop artists' names in posts on Reddit - specifically in the r/hiphopheads subreddit. This will allow for us to see what rappers are most popular and hopefully visualize that data in a pretty way.

## TODO
- [x] Set up project
- [ ] Scrape Reddit for data
- [ ] Find a good Python data visualization library 
- [ ] Launch this as a web application on my website
